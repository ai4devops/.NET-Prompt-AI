# üìù Exercise - .NET - AI Prompting Workshop

## üéØ How to Work on This Workshop

Clone the project:

```bash
git clone <ADD FINAL REPO URL>
```

Create a branch for yourself if possible so you can push your results to a unique branch.

> WorkshopPromptingAI_YYYY_MM_DD_firstname_lastname

The folders are divided by exercise, `exercice1`, `exercice2`, etc. Each exercise has a `README.md` that is
self-sufficient because:

- It provides you with the exercise instructions
- It serves as your working environment
- Your solutions are to be added directly in the `README.md` of each folder

The goal here is to use your generative AI assistant in practicing prompt engineering techniques.

Your attempts might not be successful on the first try, so feel free to include detailed explanations in addition to the
prompt that helped you solve our different use cases.

It's also important to include the response returned by your generative AI assistant.

Well, if you're ready, let's start with folder exercise1!

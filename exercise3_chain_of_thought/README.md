# üìù Exercise3 - Chain of Thought ~ 10 minutes

The "chain of thought" technique involves guiding the model through a reasoning process to explain each step of the
thought process. Here, we use this method to generate .NET documentation.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Case 1: Create a Prompt for the Model to Write Documentation for .NET Code

Possible example:

```
Here is my code:
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/clients/{clientId}", (string clientId) =>
{
    return Results.Text("John Doe");
});

app.MapPost("/clients", () =>
{
    return Results.Text("Client updated!");
});

app.Run();
Write documentation for this API service.
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below: üëÄ

```
Create a prompt for the model to write documentation for .NET code.
```

## Client Management API

### Introduction

This API service allows managing client information via two endpoints: one to get information on a specific client and
one to update a client's information.

### Endpoints

#### 1. GET /clients/:clientId

- **Description**: Retrieves information about a client based on their ID.
- **Parameter**: `clientId` (string) ‚Äì the client's identifier.
- **Example response**: John Doe

#### 2. POST /clients

- **Description**: Updates a client's information.
- **Example response**: Client updated!

### Usage

To use this API service, send HTTP requests to the specified endpoints using the base URL.
**Example usage with curl:**

# Retrieve client information

curl http://localhost:5000/clients/123

# Update a client

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/clients -d "Client updated!"
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use Case 2: Create a Prompt for the Model to Document the Same API Using a Specific Methodology

Possible example:

```
Write documentation for this API service using the OpenAPI methodology.
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below: üëÄ

```
Create a prompt for the model to document the same API using a specific methodology.
```

What was the response?

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0

  title: Client Management API

          application/json:
            schema:
              type: string
            example: John Doe

  post:

    requestBody:
      required: true
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: string
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Success
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: string
            example: Client updated!
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Use Case 3: Compare Your Two Responses and Test Other Methodologies or Custom Plans

Feel free to explore other documentation methodologies or customize plans to test how the model adapts to different
structures and requirements.

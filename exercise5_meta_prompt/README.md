# üìù Exercise5 - Meta-Prompt ~ 10 minutes

The meta-prompt involves asking the model to create a prompt itself using specific parameters. This method allows
exploring new possibilities while automating prompt creation.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Case 1: Create a Prompt for the Model to Create a Prompt on a Topic

Possible example:

```
Write an AI prompt to help me generate a to-do list of best practices for developing a .NET project.
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below:  üëÄ

```
Create a prompt for the model to create a prompt for a topic.
```

What was the response?

```
Here is a prompt you can use to generate a to-do list of best practices for a .NET project:
"List best practices for developing a .NET project, focusing on component structure, service management, routing configuration, and unit testing. Make sure to include suggestions on performance optimization, security management, and recommendations for using .NET."
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use Case 2: Create a Prompt Asking the Model to Generate a Prompt Combining Multiple Methods of Prompting

Possible example:

```
Write an AI prompt that combines the "act like" method and the "chain of thought" method to generate a list of best practices for a .NET project.
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below:  üëÄ

```
Create a prompt asking the model to generate a prompt combining multiple methods of prompting.
```

What was the response?

```
Here is a prompt combining the "act like" method and the "chain of thought" method to generate .NET best practices:
"Act like a .NET expert. Using a step-by-step reasoning (chain of thought), generate a list of best practices for developing a .NET project. Describe each best practice explaining why it is important and how it improves the project's quality. Focus on code structure, performance optimization, state management, testing, and security."
```

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Analysis of Provided Examples

***Simple Meta-Prompt:***
The first exercise asks the model to generate an effective prompt for a to-do list of .NET best practices. The solution
suggests a well-structured prompt, covering essential aspects like component structure and service management.

***Combined Meta-Prompt:***
The second exercise uses the "act like" and "chain of thought" methods to generate a complex prompt, where the model
must think step-by-step and act as an expert. The response demonstrates a thoughtful approach to combining the two
techniques, providing detailed results.
